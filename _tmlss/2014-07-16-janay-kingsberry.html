  testimonial_text: ! "For almost a year-and-a-half, I had the rewarding opportunity
    to work under Carl’s leadership during his time as Digital Media Manager and Online
    Editor for the Savannah Morning News and savannahnow.com. \r\n\r\nDuring his tenure,
    Carl reinvigorated my journalistic efforts as an online content producer with
    hands-on web training, valuable expertise and knowledge of current media trends
    and exemplary practices for enhancing storytelling and audience engagement. \r\n\r\nHe
    is a fierce team leader, a thorough communicator and an exceptional motivator,
    often instilling confidence in me when I didn’t think I could accomplish advanced
    digital tasks on my own. His strengths as an instructor helped me to master web
    and mobile app development, data visualization and other interactive tools to
    produce more effective story packages and creative content. \r\n\r\nCarl also
    lobbied for opportunities that would allow his team members to gain professional
    development and greater exposure in the journalism industry. Most notably, in
    October 2013, I traveled with him to the Online News Association conference in
    Atlanta where we joined highly engaged digital professionals to discuss tools
    and techniques advancing the value of news media. It was my first time networking
    with leading digital journalists from around the country. \r\n\r\nCarl’s time
    at the Savannah Morning News tremendously altered the newsroom’s collective approach
    to digital practices. Even after his employment, he still readily and generously
    offers consultation, advice and support in any of our company’s endeavors. We
    continue to value his passionate work ethics and eagerness to teach, and our team
    is significantly better because of his contributions"
