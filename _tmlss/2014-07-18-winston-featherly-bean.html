  testimonial_text: Carl set the bar for news reporting at the Oxford Student, where
    I had the good fortune of working with him as an editor. He was the model of a
    dedicated, tenacious reporter, bringing intelligence and a craftsman’s passion
    to every story. Carl innovated too, pitching and executing a successful redesign
    of the paper’s website. And working with him was a joy on a personal level – he
    made quite a splash in our stolid British student newsroom. We often held up Carl’s
    work as an exemplar after he left Oxford. I am sure he will inspire future colleagues
    too.
