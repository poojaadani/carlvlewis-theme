  testimonial_text: ! "I am a reporter for the Daily Telegraph in London but knew
    Carl Lewis when we studied together at Oxford University.\r\nWe both worked on
    The Oxford Student newspaper, where I served as reporter and news editor, rising
    to become editor and then head of investigations.\r\nIn those latter two roles,
    Carl worked alongside me as reporter and news editor and it is a mark of his character
    that he was both the best colleague and my toughest competition on the staff.\r\nCarl
    put in long hours and they paid off with splash af^er splash, several of which
    were picked up by national\r\nnewspapers. One of these, which appeared in the
    Daily Mail, credited Carl as joint reporter - and deservedly so given the piece
    was almost all his own woric.\r\nHe was enthusiastic and lively, a great team
    player keen to encourage more junior members of staff. But perhaps what made the
    greatest impression was his ability to temper tenacity with empathy: he was determined
    to get the\r\nstory but also to understand his sources and to act with impeccable
    ethics.\r\nI now work for one of Britain's biggest daily papers and I have rarely
    encountered people of such quality as Carl. I am confident that he would exceed
    your expectations."
