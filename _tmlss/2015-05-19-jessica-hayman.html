  testimonial_text: ! "I had the pleasure of working with Carl during my time as the
    social media intern for the Savannah Morning News. As my mentor, Carl made it
    his responsibility to teach me everything he knew about social media, digital
    media and journalism. He was a kind, informative and patient teacher who made
    every day a learning experience. His passion for the digital world was easily
    contagious and inspired me to learn all that I could while under his leadership.
    \r\n\r\nWhen I had questions, Carl would take the time to answer them, explaining
    in full detail the task at hand. If I didn’t understand, he never got discouraged
    or angry. Instead, he would quickly adapt and find a way of explaining things
    to me in a way that I could understand. \r\n\r\nCarl has a natural affinity for
    teaching that surpasses his age and experience. He can easily assess the skill
    level of his students and, as a teacher, he can navigate a way of learning that
    best fits the students needs. \r\n\r\nAfter three months under Carl’s guidance,
    I felt very confident in my ability to manage my client’s social media and my
    ability to work independently as a digital media manager. He supplied me with
    the skill sets that would later make me look very profitable to future employers
    and because of this I am very grateful. I came away from this internship with
    an expansive knowledge of the digital media world and I owe all of that to Carl’s
    mentoring and leadership. Anyone would be lucky to have a teacher like him! "
