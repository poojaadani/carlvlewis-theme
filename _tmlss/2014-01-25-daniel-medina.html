  testimonial_text: ! "Carl was a colleague of mine while we were both studying at
    Columbia Journalism School in 2011-2012, and he later went on to become a professional
    mentor-of-sorts to me after he moved back to New York City, at least in terms
    of digital media. Although Carl underwent two significant profound family losses
    in just a year-and-a-half’s time – losses that would have shaken even the most
    committed of journalists and developers – he never gave up hope, spending hours
    teaching himself new skills while simultaneously balancing a slew of family obligations.
    \r\n\r\nShortly after losing his father to melanoma while we were in graduate
    school, Carl and I worked together on a project for a story I was writing for
    The New York Times, and that also was part of Columbia’s annual Innovation Showcase.
    Carl took charge of all multimedia aspects of the project, putting together an
    interactive flowchart in a matter of hours and assembling all the presentation
    materials to perfection. He put in his 100 percent in during a time in his life
    when most people wouldn’t have the fortitude to put in 50 percent. \r\n\r\nThe
    most notable trait that sets Carl apart in my mind is his genuine, intellectually-driven
    passion for data visualization and digital news that has never seemed to be motivated
    by the allure of having a “big name media” job or a byline in a national publication.
    While many of his much-less digitally-talented peers stayed in New York following
    graduation to strive after the “perfect” brand name news gig, Carl opted to honor
    his family obligations by taking a leadership position at the daily newspaper
    in Savannah, Ga., just two hours away from his mom in south Georgia so that he
    could visit her more often. I don’t know of many people with as much talent in
    the media industry as Carl who would make that kind of sacrifice. It’s a testament
    to his loyalty – a loyalty that would be an attribute for any company that has
    the opportunity to have him join their team."
