  testimonial_text: Working with Carl is pure joy...he's on top of his digital game
    no doubt, but he brings his special brand of humor and wit to bear on the marketing
    and branding department. Carl will thrive in an entrepreneurial environment, wearing
    multiple hats. He's enthusiastic about "big data" and tackling complex problems.
    He's as comfortable working with a team as he is contributing to projects from
    his own corner of the world. If you're looking for someone who brings a fresh
    outlook to his work, who is constantly evolving, and who is passionate about building
    a quality digital experience, look no further than Carl V. Lewis.
