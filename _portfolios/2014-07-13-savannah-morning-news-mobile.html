<p>For my final project at <a href="http://savannahnow.com"><em>Savannah Morning News</em></a>, my team undertook a massive two-week overhaul of the company's mobile news app, which had previously been tethered to a legacy, contracted vendor that allowed us little flexibility and provided a poor user experience.</p>
<p>As much as I'm an advocate of open-source, the time constraints for this project simply didn't allow us that flexibility. So, we went with an awesome,<a href="http://shoutem.com" target="_blank"> pay-per-month vendor</a> that gave us complete autonomy over design for a small fee per month.</p>
