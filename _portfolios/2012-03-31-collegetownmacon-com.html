<p>During my sophomore year of college, I received funding from the Knight Foundation to develop an online student guide to Macon, Ga. as part of the local revitalization group's efforts to bridge the gap between town and gown. I worked with my Civic and Community journalism class at Mercer to produce content for the site, then acquired funding from the Knight Foundation and the College Hill Alliance to purchase domain space for and publicize the project. Using WordPress as my CMS, I then made use of my PHP and CSS/HTML5 knowledge, along with my design background, to produce the site.  The result was a dynamic, user-driven guide to the hipper elements of Georgia's third-largest city. <a href="http://collegetownmacon.com">Click here</a> to see the site live.</p>
