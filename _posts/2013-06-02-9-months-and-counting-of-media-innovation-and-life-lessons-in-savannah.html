<p>Since beginning a full-time position as "Digital Media Manager" at Savannah Morning News &amp; <a href="http://savannnahnow.com">savannahnow.com</a> last August, I haven't been blogging or tweeting about digital media, news innovation and interactive marketing much here or on other social platforms with enough frequency. I've been too busy putting my thoughts into action on the job, and boy has it been much harder than I ever imagined.</p>
<p>Serendipity and timing landed me here in Savannah last August more than anything else. Part of me wanted to stay in New York City/Columbia and pursue more intensely my growing interests in data visualization and media startup strategy (you can thank <a href="http://susanemcgregor.com/">Susan E. McGregor</a> and <a href="http://sav.mn/13eKgul">Ava Seave</a>, respectively, for stoking my curiosity in those two topics, as well as everyone else at Columbia'a <a href="http://www.journalism.columbia.edu/page/628-tow-center-for-digitaljournalism" target="_blank">Tow Center for Digital Journalism</a>). And it didn't hurt, too, that I'd met some amazing, brilliant friends in the city who I was  hard-pressed to leave behind (cue: <a href="https://twitter.com/dmedin11">Daniel Medina</a>, <a href="https://mhkeller.com" target="_blank">Michael Keller</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>But the <a href="http://www.musicfuneralhome.com/_mgxroot/page_10780.php?id=1042744">death of my dad</a> last March after a long and courageous three-year battle with melanoma  – not to mention the inexplicable, often irrational emotion of homesickness – compelled me to go back to Georgia and spend some overdue quality time with my mom, to help us both get back on our feet after the loss of the greatest man in our lives. And so it was. After a five-year whirlwind of college, extracurriculars, internships, early-career successes and an intense year of graduate studies, I was on a flight from LaGuardia headed back to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brantley_County,_Georgia" target="_blank">Brantley County, Ga</a>., to move in for the summer with my mom, who now lived alone. I won't lie. Some part of me felt guilty for putting off my career interests for 4 months for the sake of family. But looking back now, it was one of the most sensible decisions I'd ever made.</p>
