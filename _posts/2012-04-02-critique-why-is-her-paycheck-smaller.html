<p><a href="http://carlvlewis.net/critique-why-is-her-paycheck-smaller/"><img class=" wp-image-2177 " title="halflife_density-1" src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2012-05-07-at-5.42.40-AM.png" alt="" width="393" height="225" /></a>
    For my final critique, I decided to look at a more straightforward and well-known <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2009/03/01/business/20090301_WageGap.html">visualization on gender wage gaps</a> created by The New York Times back in 2010. The "Why is Her Paycheck Smaller" visualization shows how simple, mostly static scatter plots can sometimes be the most efficient and informative way to tell a story.</p>
<p>Functionality-wise, the visualization is not terribly impressive. Not only does it run on clunky, often-inoperable Flash, but it has little in terms of interactivity. All you basically do is click on each of the occupations to see where the dots for that occupation fall, and then mouse over the dots to see more specific information. The clean, crisp design, on the other hand, makes the colored dots stand out, basking in the surrounding minimalism. The notations help explain possible outliers without cluttering the graph, and the charts on the bottom right put the data into a larger context neatly and concisely.</p>
<p>For its time, this visualization probably was cutting-edge. But despite its less sophisticated technologies looking back now, it communicates just as powerfully as any of the best visualizations do in 2012. The "Why is her Paycheck Smaller" visualization shows that, no matter what technology, good charting, design and editing makes for a strong story. It's easy to get caught up in the technologies, but sometimes less is more.</p>
