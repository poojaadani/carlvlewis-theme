<p>Two days from now will mark exactly one year since I accepted a position here in Savannah, Ga. on an unforeseen whim prompted by a call from our  V.P. of Audience and digital media visionary <a href="http://twitter.com/yelvington">Steve Yelvington</a>. According to my job description, I head up digital content strategy and news product development efforts for the soon-to-be rebranded "<a href="http://savannahnow.com/exchange/2013-04-20/savannah-morning-news-and-savannahnowcom-announce-launch-main-street-digital#.Ug2USWRATCk">Savannah Media Network</a>" (known by most folks simply by the acronym SMN, which conveniently also stands for <a href="http://savannahnow.com">Savannah Morning News</a> – our daily print newspaper product  – but consists of <a href="http://dosavannah.com">much</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/storm-guide-by-savannahnow.com/id650730053?mt=8">much</a> more).  As you can tell from my  precipitous decline in blogging frequency, I've been tasked with a big workload – one that varies day-by-day from programming <a href="http://multimedia.savannahnow.com/media/sexoffendersdb/#.Ug2WkGRATCk">news apps</a>, to formatting content in Drupal, to good old-fashioned reporting.</p>
