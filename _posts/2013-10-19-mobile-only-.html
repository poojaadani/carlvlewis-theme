<p>The digital publishing industry has been evangelizing about the imperative of going "mobile-first" for so long now that the term's almost become cliche (if I hear one more person taut a site as "cutting-edge" simply because it has an adaptive HTML5 layout, I might just lose my sanity). But I forget that not even a year ago, the industry was only <em>starting</em> to think about mobile in a serious way. Exactly one year ago, 24 percent of our traffic for Savannah Morning News and its associated digital properties came from mobile devices. What's that number now? 46.3 percent! That's a 100 percent increase year over year.<em>or</em></p>
<p>Which leads me to my point: With mobile, we're not looking at a mere shift in user patterns comparable to, say, the rise of on-demand video streaming alongside the steady, only slightly diminished use of television and cable . We're looking at a revolution – one akin to the death of the home phone, the compact disc and the typewriter. Aside from the <em>creators, </em>the power-user minority of professionals in technology or media or processor-intensive professions who need a desktop or laptop machine because of the nature of their job requirements –  we could very well be looking at a <em>mobile-only</em> future, especially when it comes to content consumption. Look no further than the overnight success of mobile-only <a href="http://instagram.com">Instagram</a> for evidence). Even at a legacy news site such as savannahnow.com, which typically tends to skew older, almost half of our users now access our content using mobile or tablet devices. <em>Half</em>.</p>
<p>So if your digital space isn't mobile-friendly (cue: <a href="http://searchengineland.com/only-6-of-top-100-fortune-500-companies-have-sites-that-comply-with-googles-mobile-requirements-164748">94 percent</a> of Fortune 500 websites), it's only  accessible (in the sense, ) to half of your potential customers. With mobile/tablet consumption continuing to grow at unprecedented speed, we're for the first time nearing the dawn of mobile as the primary digital platform. </p>
<p><strong>Death of native news apps</strong><br />
I've grappled with this question in my mind over and over in recent months.</p>
