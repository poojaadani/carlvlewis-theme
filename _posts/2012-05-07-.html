<p>When Apple first launched its App Store in 2009, CEO Steve Jobs promised consumers the marketplace would be "walled-garden" to third-party app approval. No app would be given the green light without rigorous  review and inspection by Apple developers and product testers. Apple would keep consumers safe by making sure nothing foul or seedy got past the wall, while</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what was once a walled garden has since turned into a virtual bed of weeds. Hundreds of flimsy, dubious apps dominate the marketplace</p>

<p>1. Lock Screen - At just $1.99, the Lock Screen app promises, well, to lock your screen. There's just little problem, however: it doesn't actually lock anything. In its description, the app promises an array of impressive security features such as "voice recognition," "fingerprint scan" and "Android-like 'connect-the-dots' security" to "keep your data private and secure."  But upon purchasing the app, you find out that it's actually only a collection of poorly-designed background wallpapers with designs that only pretend to lock your screen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app has received 41 customer ratings –– 22 of those ratings give the app glowing five-star reviews, while the remaining 19 of them call the scam out with the lowest possible one star-rating. "They're just ripping you off. It's a picture, not a lock. It does nothing at all to lock your iPhone," said one reviewer from California named Greg. Another scorned reviewer, Mikeywhatsgood, said: "I don't believe the App Store would even allow this app to be available to buy." But because the app has been artificially boosted by so many scam five-star ratings, it has an average rating of three stars, allowing it to go undetected by Apple and remain for purchase by unsuspecting consumers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company that sells the app, Fox Mobile, did not appear in Google search results, and had no traces online of its existence. According to the iTunes store, the company sells two other apps –– one called 'Lockitizer' that is an exact duplicate of LockScreen except under a different name and another called 'Live Themes' that promises to jazz up your phone with custom wallpapers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>An earlier version of the Lock Screen app was released in March under the title "LockYourScreen" and was for a short period on the top 10 paid apps list. But was pulled from the store in late April after receiving more than 1,000 abysmal one-star ratings. It didn't take the makers of the app long, however, to sneak back into the store under a different title. Lock Screen was released just eight days later on May 3.</p>

<p>2. Microsoft Word 2010 - Mastering in 24h: Looking to have a copy of Microsoft Word installed on your device so you can edit on-the-go? If so, don't be fooled into shelling out $11.99 for this app that appears at first glance to be a functional copy of Word 2010, complete with the Office 2010 and Microsoft Word logos.</p>
