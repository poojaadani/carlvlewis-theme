<p>The last time I went home to visit my parents, I forgot to pack my razor. So naturally, my mom, being the ever-accommodating matriarch she is, offered to let me use one of her pink disposable women's razors instead. I politely turned down her offer, shuddering at the thought of what such a 'feminine' product might do to my finely-groomed man stubble.</p>
<p>Turns out, I was probably just splitting hairs. In a recent side-by-side product comparison of Gillette's low-end men's and women's disposable razor lines, I found little difference performance-wise between the two gender-branded products. In fact, on average, the women's Gillette throwaway razors are generally cheaper than their male counterparts.</p>
<p>At at least three different Duane Reade pharmacies in New York City, the retail price for an 11-pack of Gillette Daisy razors for women was $10.99. That's about 10 cents less per razor than the brand's almost identical Custom Plus line for men, which carried a price tag of $11.99 for the same quantity package. Not to mention, two of the three pharmacies were running an additional one dollar discount on the women's line of razors, bringing their cost further down to $9.99 per pack, or about 30 cents less per razor.</p>
<p>The men's and women's razors have exactly the same shape, size, handle and blade angle, and they're both made from the same lightweight plastic material. Aside from color, the only real difference between the two products is that the women's razor has an additional 'comfort-smooth-strip,' which, if anything, should theoretically make it more expensive than the men's razor, at least from a production standpoint.</p>
<p>One possible argument for the price disparity is that the men's razors are designed to give a closer shave than the women's razors, so the manufacturer can charge more for the men's line. Yet after two sets of trial experiments using both products, I noticed little difference in the quality of my morning shave. Both the men's and women's disposable razors tackled my five o' clock shadow with relative ease, and took about the same time of 10 minutes to use. Much to my surprise, these disposable razors might have even done a better job than my high-end cordless electric shaver does.</p>
<p>The only slight difference I noticed in performance is that the men's razor tended to cut my skin a bit more easily, but it still didn't give any closer of a shave than the women's razor. I guess that might've been the lubricating strip of the women's razor in action, insulating my skin from the harsher knicks.</p>
<p>Perhaps the manufacturers can charge less for the women's razors since, in theory, women go through razors quicker than men and therefore produce more frequent sales. After all, most women tend to shave their entire legs every day, while men only have to trim a much smaller area around their face and neck, and often can go a as many as three days between shaves.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Gillette's disposable men's razors cost more than the nearly identical, if not superior, women's line of the same product. At best, the company is selling the same product in a different color at different price tags based upon supply and demand. At worst, it's exploiting gender-based preferences to lure men into paying more than women for the same item.</p>
<p>So in the end, I could've saved a last-minute run to the store and a few bucks if I'd simply used one of my mom's razors. From now on, though, whenever I buy disposable razors, I'm going with the women's brand, even if it is pink.</p>
<p>Gillette might want to take a cue from toothbrush manufacturers, who offer their products in an array of different colors without making claims of gender distinctions. It'd make this consumer a lot happier.</p>
