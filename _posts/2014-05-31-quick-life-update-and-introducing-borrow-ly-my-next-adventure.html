<p>In the long-overdue 7 months since I last posted here, I've gone through <a href="http://carlvlewis.tumblr.com/post/83499686044/coming-to-terms-with-the-harsh-heartbreaking-reality" target="_blank">one of the most difficult situations of my life</a> – one which I'm not seeking your sympathy for, and also not embarrassed to admit the depression the loss brought on.  I'll leave all <a href="http://carlvlewis.tumblr.com/post/83499686044/coming-to-terms-with-the-harsh-heartbreaking-reality" target="_blank">that stuff</a> to Tumblr for you to read should you wish</p>

<p>It's taken me four months to reach a point of personal acceptance at mom's loss, but I'm already <a href="http://borrowly.com" target="_blank">jumping up</a>. A quotation that went viral on social media after the loss of legendary southern poet Maya Angelou this week cemented my will to get back up, and do so with no inhibitions.

<p>My work on <a href="http://borrow.ly" target="_blank">borrow.<span style="text-decoration: underline;">ly</span></a>  – a first-of-its-kind  geofenced neighborhood household item-sharing platform – has already received positive feedback regarding its business model, both from <a href="http://quantummedia.com/Our_Team/Principals/Ava_Seave/" target="_blank">Ava Seave</a> of Quantum Media and Columbia Business School, and from NYC tech-startup collectives such as StartupBoost, which <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Startup-Boost-New-York-City/events/174201502/" target="_blank">recently listed</a> borrow.ly as "one of the hottest startups in Silicon Alley."  Check out the gallery below to get a sneak-peek at what's to come:</p>

<p>Oh, and did I mention I start a Data Science with Python course at<a href="%20http://GeneralAssemb.ly" target="_blank"> GeneralAssemb.ly</a> Tuesday? Looking forward to learning even more as I build borrow.ly out.</p>
