<strong>Carl V. Lewis</strong> is a data/interactive journalist, front-end developer, occasional digital media educator, former digital editor and product manager, civic tech entrepreneur and perennial side-project creator with a background in interactive news design, information visualization, mobile development, data science, information visualization and audience engagement. He currently lives in Brooklyn, NY, where he is taking a data science night class at General Assemb.ly, occasionally assisting at the Tow Center for Digital Journalism on special projects, consulting newsrooms on data journalism skills and taking time for professional/personal development after the sudden, back-to-back deaths of both his parents in 2013 and 2014, whose financial affairs and legal obligations he spent much of 2014 handling. He briefly bootstrapped the hyperlocal item-sharing/classifieds service borrow.ly, a peer-to-peer hyperlocal lending platform geared toward helping publishers reclaim the classified market and strengthen communities. Previously, he was the Digital Media Manager/Online Editor for Savannah Morning News/Morning News Media and its associated digital properties, including overseeing the development, launch and content strategy for the company’s alt-weekly, DoSavannah and building several native apps, including Coastal Georgia Storm Guide and SavannahNow St. Patrick’s Day 2013, the latter of which accrued more than 18,000 users in less than a month and drove savannahnow.com to hit record unique visitors. He and his team of two employees also received top honors for social media strategy among all 26 Morris Publishing Group markets, and his digital classifieds prototype SavSwap not only was taken on as a Morris-wide product, but won an honorable mention for the Online News Association’s selective M.J. Bear Fellowship. Prior to moving to Savannah, he earned a master’s degree in digital media and data visualization from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, where he was awarded multiple honors in courses including data journalism and information design, media business models and consumer awareness. He was previously on staff at the The Telegraph newspaper in Macon, Ga., and has held print and online editing positions at The Oxford Student and The Mercer Cluster, the latter of which he built the digital products for in 2011. In 2014, he earned a Certification in Project Management from Stanford University’s online learning program. He’s also worked as an adjunct instructor at Mercer University’s Center for Collaborative Journalism. He also remotely co-advises his former student newspaper, The Cluster, on digital publishing best practices.
Prior to entering graduate school, Carl attended Mercer University and the Center for Collaborative Journalism, where he graduated summa cum laude with a 3.94 GPA in 2011, earning a dual honors degree in journalism and media studies (JMS) and southern studies. He was a Robert C. Byrd Honors Fellow and a Mercer Service Scholars, and as a senior was named among the top five Mercer graduates poised to make a positive difference in their communities and the world. While at Mercer, he developed and launched the digital edition of his student-run newspaper, MercerCluster.com, and received funding from the Knight Foundation to develop and implement an online user-generated guide to the City of Macon, instructing a 200-level class to complete the project. During his year abroad at the University of Oxford, he sat as news editor of the university’s official student-run newspaper, The Oxford Student, and spearheaded a redesign of the publication’s website, in addition to holding regular workshops for the paper’s staffers on content strategies for the web. He also served as web editor of Oxford’s termly arts and culture publication, Exposition Magazine,  establishing its initial online presence in 2010. He wrote his peer-reviewed, conference-presented undergraduate honors thesis on coverage of the 1961 lunch counter sit-ins in the Atlanta daily press – scholarship for which he was later invited to present  at the prestigious “Faulkner’s Legacy: Southern Writers, Southern Writing” conference at the University of Mississippi.  His 2010 paper “Thomas Nelson Page’s Cultural Theft: ‘Marse Chan’ and ‘Meh Lady’ as Blackface Performance” won the Valerie B. Edmonds Research Award for unique undergraduate scholarship, and was later published by Mercer University Press in The Spires, the University’s bi-yearly, interdisciplinary research journal showcasing notable university research projects across all disciplines. His journalism has also appeared in in The Daily Mail (UK), The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, City Limits Magazine and The Augusta Chronicle.</p>

<p>Before starting work in Savannah, Carl covered the Norwood and Kingsbridge sections of the Bronx for the hyperlocal news site, BronxInk.org, and served as editor of the website for the Society of Professional Journalists, the student governing body of Columbia Journalism School. His master’s thesis focuses on the history of The Philadelphia Inquirer‘s suburban strategy in light of the paper’s recent financial woes, and earned top marks for going beyond the longform requirements to produce original research in the field. He currently resides in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn. To contact Carl, click here, or call (912) 816-7007 or (917) 397-6799.</p>
