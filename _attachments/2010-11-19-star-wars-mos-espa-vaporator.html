    was a spaceport on Tatooine. It was the home of Anakin and Shmi Skywalker and
    also held the famous Mos Espa Grand Arena, at which the annual Boonta Eve Classic
    podrace was held, and the location of Watto''s shop.


    Designed around a central market place, Episode I''s Mos Espa is much, much larger
    than Episode IV''s Mos Eisley. Just outside Tozeur, Tunisia, the production crew
    assembled several key avenues of the marketplace, using sculpted foam and plaster
    around wire mesh frames to make lightweight Tatooine architecture.


    On July 28, 1997, much of the Mos Espa set was dashed apart by a furious rainstorm.
    Producer Rick McCallum quickly rearranged the shooting schedule to take advantage
    of the sets that still stood while the construction crew dilligently worked to
    rebuild the wreckage. This skillful troubleshooting resulted in the Tatooine sequences
    being finished on schedule without losing a single day.";s:17:"created_timestamp";s:10:"1272883952";s:9:"copyright";s:22:"Ulrich
